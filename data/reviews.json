    "review": "Had gone to this restaurant after reading some good reviews about it Dont know why so much of hype created\n\nThe food was a insipid here Had ordered for a chicken Wonton soup which was bland and the was a Lil sticky\nAmong starters had ordered whole pepper chicken it was very salty and after complaining about it it was altered just by adding some more spices and it tasted even worse\n\nHad ordered fiery chilly chicken outside it was coated with green chilly paste and not cooked well And at last we had ordered for a veg hongkong noodles which tasted good\n\nBut definitely would appreciate their ambience service and hygiene and can be given 3 ratings for the same They have paly area for kids as well so that parents can have some leisure time \n\nLastly they dont have parking space need to park to opp Bda complex area And the exorbitant price is not worthy I felt"
